# The Boot and Runtime Services - Test Suite
The Boot and Runtime Services (BRS) specification provides the requirements for system vendors and Operating System Vendors (OSVs) to interoperate by meeting expectations of the Operating System (OS) for device discovery, system management, and other operations in the specification.

For more information, see the [BRS specification](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-os-a-see/).

The BRS test suite project is based on the original BBR-ACS (Base Boot Requirements - Architecture Compliance Suite) project. The test suite is designed to check for compliance against BRS specifications. These tests are also delivered through two runtime executable environments:
  - UEFI Self Certification Tests (SCT)
  - Firmware Test Suite (FWTS)

#### Prerequisites
Ubuntu 22.04 or Docker environment for compatible versions, with at least 20GB of free disk space.
To prevent potential issues, please ensure there is no whitespace (e.g., spaces, tabs, line breaks, carriage returns) in the PATH environment variable. E.g. if you're on WSL, you might want a clean environment without the Windows paths like '/mnt/c/Program Files/'.
If you're new to the BRS GitHub repository and just want to try running the BRS test suite on a QEMU platform, here's a quick one-step script to build firmware and a live image and run it on a QEMU platform:
- `git clone https://github.com/intel/rv-brs-test-suite.git && cd rv-brs-test-suite/brsi/scripts/  && ./build-scripts/start_qemu.sh `
#### Steps to Build and Run RV BRS test suite live image
- `git clone https://github.com/intel/rv-brs-test-suite.git`
- `cd rv-brs-test-suite/brsi/scripts/`
- `./build-scripts/get_brsi_source.sh`

	This script will automatically download the required components from the following sources:
	| repo  | source/release            |branch/tag/commit|
	| ------------- | ------------------------------ |------------------|
	| `edk2`  | https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.git       |branch:edk2-stable202308|
	| `UEFI-SCT`   | https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-test     |commit:81dfa8d5|
	| `grub`   | https://github.com/tekkamanninja/grub.git     |tag:riscv_devel_Nikita_V3|
	| `kernel`   | https://github.com/vlsunil/linux.git     |tag:6.6-rc7 ac5e19d0|
	| `buildroot`   | https://github.com/buildroot/buildroot.git     |branch:2023.02|
	| `FWTS`   | https://fwts.ubuntu.com/release/fwts-V23.09.00.tar.gz     |version:v23.09.00|
	
	The following packages are required for the script to run smoothly. If any of these packages are missing, they will be installed:
	curl mtools gdisk gcc openssl automake autotools-dev libtool bison flex bc uuid-dev python3 libglib2.0-dev libssl-dev autopoint gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf gcc g++

- `./build-scripts/build_brsi.sh`
- `./build-scripts/build_image.sh`

If everything goes well, the live image will be available at `brsi/scripts/output/brs_live_image.img.xz`
Note: it would take around 1 hour to finish the build, if you just want to have a quick try,
you can use the prebuilt images in `rv-brs-test-suite/brsi/prebuilt_images/`
#### Firmware requiment to run SCT:
Firmware must support the ability to load a UEFI application, as it is a requirement specified in section 2.1.2 of the UEFI specification version 2.10.

#### To run the tests with QEMU and the live image, execute:
- `./build-scripts/start_qemu.sh`

	This script will automatically download the required components from the following sources:
	| repo  | source            |branch|
	| ------------- | ------------------------------ |------------------|
	| `QEMU`  | https://github.com/vlsunil/qemu.git       |branch:riscv_acpi_b2_v7|
The RiscVVirtQemu firmware will build for qemu virt platform.
This would start the live image and automatically run the UEFI SCT and FWTS tests without intervention.

## UEFI Self Certification Tests
UEFI SCT tests the UEFI implementation requirements defined by the BRS specification.

**Prerequisite**: Ensure that the system time is correct before starting SCT tests.

### Running SCT
The BRS SCT tests are built as part of the test suite. <br />

Running BRS SCT tests is now automated. You can choose to skip the automated SCT tests by pressing any key when the UEFI shell prompts.

- Shell>Press any key to stop the EFI SCT running

To run SCT manually, follow these steps:


1. `Shell>FS(X):`
- `FS(X):>cd EFI\BOOT\brs\SCT`
- To run BRS tests
 `FS(X):EFI\BOOT\brs\SCT>SCT -s BRSI.seq`
- To run all tests
 `FS(X):EFI\BOOT\brs\SCT>SCT -a -v`


If you want to try running SCT on real hardware instead of QEMU, please follow these steps:

1. Mount the image by running `sudo losetup --partscan --find --show brsi/scripts/output/brs_live_image.img` and assign it to `/dev/loopX`, where X is a number specific to your system.
2. Run `sudo mount /dev/loopXp1 /mnt/brs` to mount the partition at `/mnt/brs`.
3. Copy the `/mnt/brs/EFI/BOOT/brs` directory to the hardware UEFI partition `e.g. FS(X):EFI\BOOT\`.
4. Run the BRS tests by executing the command `FS(X):EFI\BOOT\brs\SCT>SCT -s BRSI.seq`, similar to how it is done in QEMU.

To generate an SCT test report in CSV format, you can use the following command:

```
SCT -r <Reportname>
```

The test report will be generated under the `./report/<reportname>` directory. Please replace `<Reportname>` with your desired name for the report.

If the test case requires additional arguments, please update the corresponding .ini file before generating the live image. Refer to this `./common/patches/Update-test-profile-for-MemRead_Func-as-an-example.patch` for an example.

You can also select and run tests individually. For more information on running SCT, see the [SCT User Guide](http://www.uefi.org/testtools).

### Manual intervention tests
Some SCT tests require manual intervention or interaction.
To run the tests, follow these steps.

1. Move or copy the SCT logs into the result partition so they do not get overwritten.

	- `Shell>FS(Y):`
	- `FS(Y):> cd \acs_results\`
	- `FS(Y):\acs_results\> mv sct_results sct_results_orginal`

2. Run manual tests.

	- `FS(X):EFI\BOOT\brs\SCT>SCT -s BRSI_manual.seq`
 
3. While the system runs the reset tests, you may have to manually reset the system if it hangs.

**Note:** The logs for the manual tests will overwrite the logs for the original test run which is the reason to have a copy of the original test. This new folder contains the logs from the new tests run in the manual sequence file. You may to concatenate some of the logs to view together.
### SCT test log analysis
SCT log will store at:

	- `FS(Y):\acs_results\sct_results_previous_run\sct_results\Overall\>`
	- `03/22/2023  11:48           9,678,122  Summary.ekl`
	- `03/22/2023  11:48          11,523,502  Summary.log`

Take the `PlatformSpecificElements` test case as an example. This particular test case is divided into several sub-tests, and each sub-test will print a brief log to aid in debugging. This log can be particularly helpful in identifying any issues or errors that may arise during the testing process.

### Use EDK2 SCT Results Parser
EDK2 SCT Results Parser is an external parser script for UEFI SCT.
If you're using this tool to analyze BRS test results, use the following command.
```
brsi/scripts/edk2-test-parser$ ./parser.py </path/to/sct_results/Overall/Summary.ekl> </path/to/brsi_sequence_file/BRSI.seq> \
	--config </path/to/BRSI_comfig_file/brsi/config/BRSI.yaml>
WARNING ident_seq: Could not identify `/home/yin/diff/BRSI.seq'...
INFO print_summary: 64 dropped, 9 failures, 16221 pass, 54 skipped, 72 spurious, 165 warnings
```
The parsed report can be found in result.md. The generated result md can be easily converted to HTML using pandoc with:
```
$ pandoc -o result.html result.md
```
For the Detail usage of EDK2 SCT Results Parser please refence to https://gitlab.arm.com/systemready/edk2-test-parser

## Firmware Test Suite (FWTS)

The Firmware Test Suite (FWTS), a package hosted by Canonical, provides tests for ACPI, SMBIOS and UEFI. Quite a few BRS assertions are tested through FWTS, especially for BRS-I.

### Running FWTS tests manually

From the UEFI shell, you can choose to boot Linux OS by entering the command:

```
Shell>FS0:
FS0:\> cd EFI
FS0:\EFI\> cd BOOT
FS0:\EFI\BOOT\> bootriscv64.efi
```

This command loads the grub menu. Press enter to choose the option `Linux Buildroot` that boots the OS and the FWTS would run automatically after OS initialization. When the FWTS tests were done, the corresponding log file can be found at `/results.log`. What's more, if you want to debug some of the FWTS tests, you can just input the `fwts [option] [test]` command and the results will be stored under the current directory when trigger the fwts test.

### FWTS test log analysis
The FWTS test results as well as some detail error logs will be stored in the `results.log` file. If you just want to get the overall test results summary, you can just scroll down to the end of the `results.log` file and the summary will be just like below:
```
Test           |Pass |Fail |Abort|Warn |Skip |Info |

xenv           |     |     |     |     |    1|     |
xsdt           |    1|     |     |     |     |     |
---------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
Total:         |  132|    4|   13|    1|  448|    8|
---------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```
If you want to deep dive the root cause of some failed or skipped cases, you can get some clue from the detailed test logs in the results.log file.
```
bgrt: BGRT Boot Graphics Resource Table test.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACPI BGRT table does not exist, skipping test
================================================================================
0 passed, 0 failed, 0 warning, 0 aborted, 1 skipped, 0 info only.

bert: BERT Boot Error Record Table test.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACPI BERT table does not exist, skipping test
================================================================================
0 passed, 0 failed, 0 warning, 0 aborted, 1 skipped, 0 info only.

```
Alternatively, you can also run specific FWTS case by `fwts [option] [test]` to get the detailed logs on the current terminal.
